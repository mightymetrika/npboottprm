and the proportions of significant p-values for each test (ANOVA,
Kruskal-Wallis, Nonparametric Bootstrap F-test, Permutation F-test).

\description{
This function is a wrapper around \code{replext_ts2_c1.1}. The function is designed
to reproduce or extend the statistical power analysis for ANOVA (Analysis of
Variance) from Dwivedi et al. (2017) supplemental table 3, cell 1.2.
